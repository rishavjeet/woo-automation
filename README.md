### Exclusive Features

- **wp-e2e-utils-playwright Framework**: The tests are written using the **wp-e2e-utils-playwright** framework functions, which streamline the process of automating interactions with a WordPress site. This framework helps interact with the WordPress admin panel, as well as simulating user behavior on the frontend.

- **Test Data Cleanup**: Each test script includes a **data cleanup** feature to ensure that the site storage is not overpopulated with test data. After each test execution, the relevant test data (e.g., products, users, coupons) is removed, maintaining a clean environment for subsequent tests.
